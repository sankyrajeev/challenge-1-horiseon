# <Challenge-1-Horiseon>






    - I feel a perfectly balanced code is right way to perfct web application. Using sematic code would make life a lot easier for Google SEO advertisements and would also make life easy for other developers to read through code.

    - When i receieved the project i felt it contained a lot of descrepencies where the code was not balanced and semantic code was missing. I also felt the CSS code could be optimised to make the code the shorter and more effiecient to understand. An efficient code is always the best way to build an application as it makes lives very easy for devlopers to edit/add later on.

    - The biggest problem i perosnally felt here was the fact that the code was not very well optimised fpr SEO advertisments as sematic code is required for it.

    - I learnt how to optimise code for SEO. Concise code writing for easier understanding.
